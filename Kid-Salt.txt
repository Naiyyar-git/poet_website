The Goofy Girl.

By Salt

You are my poem you are my thoughts
you are in my mind, sleep or awake.
i miss you like a breath 
i miss you like taste
i miss you a sight to make soul relief.
i miss your body i miss you touch.
i miss your eyes i miss your words
i miss your scent, i miss your warmth
i miss your face and the expresssion in it.
i miss you in my house, when you are not here.
i miss you the moment you leave the door.
i like the sight of you booth when you leave.
but i like it more if you stay. 
i want to wrap you around like my teddy bear.
and you can sleep on my as if i am you bed.

                            my 5 min poetry.
