  <p>This poem is about a goofy girl i absolute love. this was written in 5 min as an excercise so forgive the terrible rhyme but meaning is 100 genuine :)</p>

<p>
<br> You are my poem you are my thoughts
<br> you are in my mind, sleep or awake.
<br>i miss you like a breath 
<br>i miss you like taste
<br>i miss you a sight to make soul relief.
<br>i miss your body i miss you touch.
<br>i miss your eyes i miss your words
<br>i miss your scent, i miss your warmth
<br>i miss your face and the expresssion in it.
<br>i miss you in my house, when you are not here.
<br>i miss you the moment you leave the door.
<br>i like the sight of you booth when you leave.
<br>but i like it more if you stay. 
<br>i want to wrap you around like my teddy bear.
<br>and you can sleep on my as if i am you bed.
